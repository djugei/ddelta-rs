#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! A rust port of [ddelta], which is a streaming and more efficient version of [bsdiff]. The
//! output created by this program is sometimes (when using [`generate`]) compatible with the
//! original C tool, [ddelta], but not with [bsdiff]. This library may use up to 5 times the old
//! file size + the new file size, (5 Ã— min(o, 2^31-1) + min(n, 2^31-1)), up to 12GiB. To control
//! this, see the `chunk_sizes` parameter of [`generate_chunked`].
//!
//! **Note**: the patches created by program should be compressed. If not compressed, the output may
//! actually be larger than just including the new file. You might want to feed the patch file
//! directly to an [encoder][XzEncoder], and read via a
//! [decoder implementing a compression algorithm][XzDecoder] to not require much disk space.
//! Additionally, no checksum is performed, so you should strongly consider doing a checksum of at
//! least either the old or new file once written.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! This crate optionally supports compiling the c library, divsufsort, which is enabled by default.
//! A Rust port is available; however, it has worse performance than the C version. If you'd like
//! to use the Rust version instead, for example if you don't have a C compiler installed, add
//! `default-features = false` to your Cargo.toml, i.e.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! ddelta = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
//! ```
